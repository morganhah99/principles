		<h3>Inheritance</h3>
		<p>Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. The benefits of inheritance are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It represents real-world relationships well</li>
			<li>It provides reusability of a code and allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.</li>
			<li>It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Below is an example of inheritance in Python</p>
