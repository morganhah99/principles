	<h1>Principles of Object Oriented Programming</h1>
		<h2>Inheritance</h2>
		<p>Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. The benefits of inheritance are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It represents real-world relationships well</li>
			<li>It provides reusability of a code and allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.</li>
			<li>It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Below is an example of inheritance in Python</p>

		<h5 id="space">Explanation</h5>
		<p>The class, Calculation is the parent class and Addition is the child class. The child class takes Calculation as an argument and inherits the attributes and methods 
		from the Calculation class.<br>
		As a result, the test function is able to create an Addition object with the Calculation properties. The Addition object is instantiated with the values of 1.0 and 2.0 using 
		the __init__ constructor method from Calculation.</br>
		and then the test function uses the get_result method from Addition to calculate the answer.
		</p>
		<h2>Polymorphism</h2>
		<p>Polymorphism simply means to have many forms. In programming, polymorphism means the same function name being used for different types. A simple example would be, print(len("length")) and print(len([10,20,30])) with the output being 6 and 3.<br>
		Below is another example.</p>
		<div>

		</div>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h5 id="space">Explanation</h5>
		<p>In this example, there are the classes Addition and Multiplication each with a test function. Both of the classes have a method named "get_result" which performs the calculations<br> 
		for the respected operation. The code below shows how Python can use two different class types. The test functions for Addition and Multiplication, each create an object for the respective 
		operation and call the "get_result" method. The "get_result" method does something different<br>
		depending on which object calls it. When an Addition object calls for it, addition is being performed. On the other hand multiplication will be performed if a Multiplication object calls the method.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Abstraction</h2>
		<p>An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class.<br>
		By defining an abstract base class, you can define a common Application Program Interface (API) for a set of subclasses. The capability is especially useful where a third-party is going to<br>
		provide implementations, such as with plugins, but can also help you with a large code-base where keeping all classes in your mind is difficult or not possible.</p>

		</div>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h5 id="space">Explanation</h5>
		<p>Calculation is the abstract class that inherits from the ABC class from the abc module. It contains a constructor method and another method that converts values into a float<br>
		and appends them into a tuple. The Addition class and the other operation classes inherit from this abstract class. The child classes all have their own compute() method which contains<br>
		the code to do the appropriate computation for the respective operation. Whenever an object is created ,the __init__ method is invoked for whatever child class<br> 
		inherited the abstract class. The hidden definitions for the __init__ method come into play by<br> 
		calling the convert_args_to_tuple_of_float method, converting the data type into a uniform type of float<br>
		Then the constructor uses those converted values to initialize to the data members of the class when an object is created.</p>
		<h2>Encapsulation</h2>
		<p>Encapsulation is one of the fundamentals concepts in Object Oriented Programming. It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within on unit. This puts<br>
		restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object's variable can only be changed<br>
		by an object's method. Those types of variables are known as private variables and are defined with a double underscore as a prefix to a name</p>
